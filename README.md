# Pre-work - *TipCalc*

**TipCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Dung Luu**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The instructions by Code Path did not specify that we had to write UI Control Events so the changes actually happens when we run the project, so I had to search for that myself, which was very rewarding once I got it done.
